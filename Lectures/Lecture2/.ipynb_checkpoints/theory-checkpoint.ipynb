    "- so far we have seen programs in `Turtle`, where the state is fixed;\n",
    "- programs can also manipulate the extension of the state, to store additional, auxiliary information;\n",
    "- this auxiliary information is often referred to as _variables_, as it can vary;\n",
    "- let us define a new language, `Var`, with the following statements:\n",
    "    - `V := N`, where `V` is a variable name and `N` is an arbitrary integer number (this is called **assignment**);\n",
    "    - `done`;\n",
    "    - `I;J`, where `I` and `J` are arbitrary statements.\n",
    "- define the semantics of `Var`, taking the time to illustrate each statement with an example, as:\n",
    "    - `eval(<V := N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[V := N]`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<done>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<I; J>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I';J>, S'` given that `eval(<I>,S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I'>, S'` and `I` $\\neq$ `done`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<done; I>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<I>, S`;\n",
    "- illustrate an example filling in the current date: `day := 2; month := 3; year := 1985; done`\n",
    "- of course this language is not very useful by itself; \n",
    "- what can we do with variables besides _writing_ them to the state? We can also read them!\n",
    "- let us augment `Var` by changing its assignment statement to:\n",
    "    - `V := E`, where `V` is a variable name and `E` becomes an _integer expression_;\n",
    "        - an expression can now be:\n",
    "            - `N`, where `N` is an integer number;\n",
    "            - `E`${_1}$ ` + E`${_2}$, where both `E`$_1$ and `E`$_2$ are expressions;\n",
    "            - `E`${_1}$ ` - E`${_2}$, where both `E`$_1$ and `E`$_2$ are expressions;\n",
    "            - `V`, where `V` is a variable name;\n",
    "- examples of expressions could be: \n",
    "    - `3 + 4`\n",

    "    - `x + x`\n",
    "    - `new_score + old_score`\n",
    "    - `year + (2 - 3)`\n",
    "    - notice that we use brackets to define priority of evaluation\n",
    "- is an expression an integer? Not really, but also yes at the same time: there is a mapping from expressions to integer values, which is their evaluation\n",

    "    - `eval(<V := N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<done>, S[V := N]`;\n",
    "    - `eval(<V := E>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<V := E'>, S` where `eval_expr(<E>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<E'>`;\n",
    "- expressions need to be able to read the state, but do not need to write it; for this reason, `eval_expr` needs to read the state, but only returns the evaluated expression:\n",
    "    - `eval_expr(<N>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `N` where `N` is a number\n",
    "    - `eval_expr(<L + R>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<L' + R>`  where `L`, `R` are both expressions and `eval_expr(<L>, S)` $\\rightarrow$ `<L'>`;\n",

    "    - `eval_expr(<10-x>, { x := 5})` $\\rightarrow$ ...\n",

    "- we can also extend our language to other operators such as `*` (multiplication);\n",
    "- we now get ambiguous expressions though: how do we interpret `3 + 10 * 2`?\n",
    "    - is it $26$ or is it $23$?\n",
    "    - we introduce operator precedence:\n",
    "        - parenthesized expressions\n",

    "- how do we turn this into semantics?\n",
    "    - there exists a _parser_, a small program that reads the code before we run it\n",
    "    - the parser knows about operator precedence and adds the parentheses automatically\n",
    "    - so if a programmer writes `3 + 10 * 2`, the parser automatically adds brackets as if we had written `3 + (10 * 2)`\n",
    "    - this means that ambiguity is solved at the language level\n",
    "- let us now see some examples of programs featuring complex expressions, and remembering the fact that assignment instructions are rewritten until they assign to a primitive:\n",
