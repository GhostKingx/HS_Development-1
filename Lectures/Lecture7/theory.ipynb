    "- for each \"problem\", we will take the following steps:\n",
    "    1. draw the figure\n",
    "    2. analyse its elements; count the rows, identify the properties of each row (length, number of spaces, etc.)\n",
    "    3. top-down, build a first raw program that prints the basic properties\n",
    "    4. when we are satisfied that our program can identify the properties, then we move on to printing by accumulating on a string\n",
    "- notice that we are in no hurry to start assembling the string (our actual output) yet\n",
    "    - instead, we take our time exploring our problem domain\n",
    "    - it is, in general, advisable to not work in a hurry to achieve one's result\n",
    "    - very often, when performing engineering work, analysis and testing achieve results quicker than just trying the fastest route towards the goal\n",

    "    - each line is just a line of $n$ asterisks, like we just built a moment ago\n",
    "        - so we actually have noticed that we do not need to solve the whole problem: we have to solve the problem of drawing a line $n$ times, but the actual line drawing we already know how to perform \n",
