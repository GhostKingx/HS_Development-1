    "We will now introduce a special instruction, which adds a fully new dimension to our programming language. This instruction will make our programs interactive and capable of handling a dialogue with the user. This will make our programs far more interesting, but at the same time more complex: users are unpredictable, and we can never determine beforehand what the user input will look like. Programs handling input should take this substantial unpredictability into account in the form of additional validation statements, which translates into added complexity of our programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will define a single instruction, `input`, which \"somehow receives\" a string from the user. We will not focus on the actual mechanism: whether it is an input dialog box, a line typed in a terminal, or something else, it does not matter to us. What does matter is that we expect to find the data from the next user input somewhere in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will therefore assume that, from now on, the state \"contains\" the sequence of all inputs that the user will ever produce for the product. This makes our state an \"oracle\" of sorts, because it knows in advance what will happen with the user. This \"trick\" is needed when defining how we manage input on paper, because of the fundamental limitation of paper not being an interactive system. This assumption is also not completely ungrounded: we assume that we already know the inputs, but these inputs will indeed be known at some point in time. So what we really do is define how the program did behave, or would behave, given inputs that **did** happen or **would** happen. These past/speculative inputs will be stored in the state. The new structure of the state will therefore be:\n",

For example, if we ask the age to the user, we could want to give as a response a different message based on the age (like `Hello child!` or `Hello young man!` or `Hello old man!`). This introduces a requirement: our program must be able to choose a statement rather than another based on some dynamical (i.e. only known at *runtime*, that is the period during which a computer program is executing) condition. To achieve this goal we can introduce the fundamental instruction to perform choices, known as the *conditional* instruction or *if-then-else*.\n",

    "Note that, while we could easily extend our syntax for conditional expressions with `elif`, we always need to have a closing `else` clause.
