    "The programs we have written so far can only perform a limited number of maximum steps. This means that they will, invariably, terminate after a given number of steps. For example, a program such as `x := 0; y := 2; done` will perform exactly two steps (ignoring the `;` statements and the management of `done; J`).\n",

For example, `x := int(input()); if x > 0 then { x := x * 2; x := x + 1 } else { x := -x; x := x * 2; x := x + 1 }; done` can perform, at most, the evaluation of four statements (when `x` is smaller or equal to zero), whereas the shortest path to `done` is only three statements. Thus, a conditional statement makes it harder, or even impossible, to determine the _exact_ number of steps, but we still know how many steps _at most_.\n",

This path we are looking for, connecting a problem input to its output, must be a *program*: we do not want to manually find the connection ourselves (that would be akin to a mathematician proving that the result is indeed formally acceptable). Instead, we want to build a program that does it for us.\n",

If the loop takes only one step, then we run either `P` or `Q`. If the loop takes two steps, then we run either `P;P`, `P;Q`, `Q;P`, `Q;Q`.
