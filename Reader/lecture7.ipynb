    "In this chapter we will build some simple programs according to some specifications which are non-trivial (that is, it is not immediately intuitive how the program is written) but at the same time also not particularly complex: the solution is a few lines of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem we will try to solve is that of drawing some simple figures on the console by putting strings together. We choose this sort of problem, because it has some immediate advantages. The first, and foremost, is that everybody understands the problem, and no domain-specific knowledge is required. Then, the problem is (per definition) easy to visualize: the result itself is _visual_. Finally, we want to help foster the intuition that there is a relationship between the problem and the code that provides a solution to it, which is almost visual in nature. There will be a one-to-one relationship between the parts that make up the problem definition, and the parts that make up the solution. We hope to make this link more intuitive by connecting code structures to something visible.\n",

    "\n",
    "For this reason, we will define our partial solutions in a different manner. Let us define $P_i$ to be the program that creates a rectangle with $i$ rows, each made up of $n$ asterisks.

Thus, we simply say that $\\Delta$ is just the program adding a row of $n$ asterisks.\n",

    "Let us close this chapter with one last challenge: drawing a pyramid. A pyramid for $n = 4$ would like as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "   *\n",
    "  ***\n",
    " *****\n",
    "*******\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At a first glance, it is again obvious that the pyramid requires, just like all other figures so far, the drawing of a series of rows. Each row is different: the _first_ row contains _one_ asterisk, the _second_ row contains _three_ asterisks, the _third_ row contains _five_ asterisks, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the row in position $i$ (so _first_ means $i=0$, _second_ means $i=1$, etc.) will contain $i \\times 2 + 1$ asterisks, as can be seen in the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    " $i$ | $i \\times 2 + 1$\n",
    ":---:|:--------:\n",
    "  $0$  |  $1$\n",
    "  $1$  |  $3$\n",
    "  $2$  |  $5$\n",
    "  $3$  |  $7$\n",
    "  $\\vdots$ | $\\vdots$\n",
    "  \n",
    "Before the asterisks, each row also features a series of spaces. The number of spaces decreases by one after each subsequent row. Specifically, the row in position $i$ contains $n-i-1$ spaces. If you think about it, the last row is in position $i = n - 1$ and should contain 0 spaces: in fact, $n-i-1$ when $i=n-1$ becomes $n-(n-1)-1=n+n+1-1=0$ (and that is what we want, 0 spaces in the last row).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let us define $T_n$ to be the program that fills in our pyramid with $n$ rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives us the following specification for a row: $R_i = S_i; A_i$, where $S_i = (\\text{s := s + \" \"})^{n-i-1}$ and $A_i = (\\text{s := s + \"*\"})^{i \\times 2 + 1}$.\n",
